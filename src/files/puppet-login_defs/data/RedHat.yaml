  QMAIL_DIR:
    value: Maildir
    enabled: false
    comment: |-
      *REQUIRED*
      Directory where mailboxes reside, _or_ name of file, relative to the
      home directory.  If you _do_ define both, MAIL_DIR takes precedence.
      QMAIL_DIR is for Qmail
  MAIL_DIR:
    value: /var/spool/mail

  UMASK:
    value: '022'
    comment: |-
      Default initial "umask" value used by login(1) on non-PAM enabled systems.
      Default "umask" value for pam_umask(8) on PAM enabled systems.
      UMASK is also used by useradd(8) and newusers(8) to set the mode for new
      home directories if HOME_MODE is not set.
      022 is the default value, but 027, or even 077, could be considered
      for increased privacy. There is no One True Answer here: each sysadmin
      must make up their mind.

  HOME_MODE:
    value: '0700'
    comment: |-
      HOME_MODE is used by useradd(8) and newusers(8) to set the mode for new
      home directories.
      If HOME_MODE is not set, the value of UMASK is used to create the mode.

      If defined, this command is run when removing a user.
      It should remove any at/cron/print jobs etc. owned by
      the user to be removed (passed as the first argument).

  CREATE_HOME:
    value: 'yes'
    comment: |-
      If useradd should create home directories for users by default
      On RH systems, we do. This option is overridden with the -m flag on
      useradd command line.

  USERGROUPS_ENAB:
    value: 'yes'
    comment: This enables userdel to remove user groups if no members exist.

  ENCRYPT_METHOD:
